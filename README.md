# Process-Scheauler

As a student, I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved simulating a process scheduler using C++ programming language. The main focus of this project was the data structure used, such as linked lists, queues, and stacks, to manage the execution of processes on a computer system.

The simulation included four types of processors - Round Robin, FCFS, SJF, and EDF - each with its own scheduling algorithm. Additionally, the project incorporated advanced features such as process killing, migrations, work stealing, and a process forking mechanism, which enhanced the efficiency and robustness of the simulation.

Throughout the project, I was responsible for developing the work stealing processor, implementing the EDF scheduling algorithm, and creating the load function and output to files feature. This involved designing and implementing the algorithmic logic, testing, and debugging the code to ensure its accuracy and efficiency, while also utilizing various data structures to manage the processes.

Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity for me to apply my knowledge of programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures. It allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of process scheduling and resource management in computer systems while also improving my skills in C++ programming.
